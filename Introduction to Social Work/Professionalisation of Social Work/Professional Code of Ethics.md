# What is Ethics?
## Background
Human, since long, have left following instinctual urge.  They control and redirect their feelings. They are largely act and operate under a set standard of the community and society. However, there have been contestation on what is right act and a wrong act.

Ethics is based on well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues.
- Ethics is two things. First, ethics refers to well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues. 
- Ethics, for example, refers to those standards that impose the reasonable obligations to refrain from social sins/evil such as rape, stealing, murder, assault, slander, and fraud. 
- Ethical standards also include those that enjoin virtues of honesty, compassion, and loyalty. And, ethical standards include standards relating to rights, such as the right to life, the right to freedom from injury, and the right to privacy. Such standards are adequate standards of ethics because they are supported by consistent and well-founded reasons.

Secondly, ethics refers to the study and development of one's ethical standards. As mentioned above, feelings, laws, and social norms can deviate from what is ethical. So it is necessary to constantly examine one's standards to ensure that they are reasonable and well-founded. Ethics also means, then, the continuous effort of studying our own moral beliefs and our moral conduct, and striving to ensure that we, and the institutions we help to shape, live up to standards that are reasonable and solidly-based.[^1]
## History and Philosophy of Ethics in India
Indian ethics was philosophical from the start. In the oldest of the Indian writings, the Vedas, ethics is an integral aspect of philosophical and religious speculation about the nature of reality.[^2]
#### Hinduism
#### Jainism
#### Buddhism
## Types of Ethics[^3]
Many people use the words Ethics and Morality interchangeably. However, there is a difference between Ethics and Morals.  
To put it in simple terms, **Ethics = Morals + Reasoning.**
### Personal Ethics
- Includes your personal values and moral qualities. 
- Influenced by family, friends, culture, religion, education and many other factors. 
- Examples: I believe racism is morally wrong. I am in favour of abortion. 
- Personal ethics can change and are chosen by an individual. 
### Common Ethics
- Common Ethics 
- Ethics that the majority of people agree on. 
- Many philosophers argue there is no such ethics. 
- Do we have the same ethics in the world? 
- Do we have the same ethics in the U.S.? 
- Does everyone in your family share the same ethics? 
- Examples: Murdering people for the sake of murder is wrong. 
- Notice how this would change in the context of self-defence. 
- Common ethics have to be very general to avoid disagreement. 
### Professional Ethics 
- Rules imposed on an employee in a company, or as member of a profession. For instance, journalists, doctors, lawyers, etc. 
- Imposed when you are a part of a professional setting or when you are being trained or educated for working for a specific profession. 
- Examples: no gossiping, time management, punctuality, confidentiality, transparency. 
- Not adhering to these may harm your professional reputation. 
## PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT [^4]
It is the responsibility of the national organisations in membership of IFSW and IASSW to develop and regularly update their own codes of ethics or ethical guidelines, to be consistent with the IFSW / IASSW statement. It is also the responsibility of national organisations to inform social workers and schools of social work about these codes or guidelines. Social workers should act in accordance with the ethical code or guidelines current in their country. These will generally include more detailed guidance in ethical practice specific to the national context. The following general guidelines on professional conduct apply: 
1. Social workers are expected to develop and maintain the required skills and competence to do their job. 
2. Social workers should not allow their skills to be used for inhumane purposes, such as torture or terrorism. 
3. Social workers should act with integrity. This includes not abusing the relationship of trust with the people using their services, recognising the boundaries between personal and professional life, and not abusing their position for personal benefit or gain. 
4. Social workers should act in relation to the people using their services with compassion, empathy and care. 
5. Social workers should not subordinate the needs or interests of people who use their services to their own needs or interests. 
6. Social workers have a duty to take necessary steps to care for themselves professionally and personally in the workplace and in society, in order to ensure that they are able to provide appropriate services. 
7. Social workers should maintain confidentiality regarding information about people who use their services. Exceptions to this may only be justified on the basis of a greater ethical requirement (such as the preservation of life).
8. Social workers need to acknowledge that they are accountable for their actions to the users of their services, the people they work with, their colleagues, their employers, the professional association and to the law, and that these accountabilities may conflict. 
9. Social workers should be willing to collaborate with the schools of social work in order to support social work students to get practical training of good quality and up to date practical knowledge.
10. Social workers should foster and engage in ethical debate with their colleagues and employers and take responsibility for making ethically informed decisions. 
11. Social workers should be prepared to state the reasons for their decisions based on ethical considerations, and be accountable for their choices and actions. 
12. Social workers should work to create conditions in employing agencies and in their countries where the principles of this statement and those of their own national code (if applicable) are discussed, evaluated and upheld.

### Conflicts of interest 
There are potential threats which may lead to conflicts of interest and lack of **independence**. 
* Self-interest 
- Self-review 
- Advocacy 
- Familiarity 
- Intimidation. 
A threat to independence is any matter, real or perceived, that implies the accountant is not providing an independent view or report in a specific situation. 
An accountant needs to be independent so others can place reliance on his/her work. Lack of independence implies bias, meaning less reliance would be placed. 

#### Example Scenario:
