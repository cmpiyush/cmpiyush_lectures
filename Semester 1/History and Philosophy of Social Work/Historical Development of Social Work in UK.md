#### A brief history of UK
##### **EARLY HISTORY**  
Among the first Britons (people who live in the United Kingdom) were the Picts, who arrived some 10,000 years ago likely from mainland Europe. In the sixth century B.C., the Celts arrived from Europe, and the Picts moved north into Scotland. In A.D. 43, the Romans invaded and ruled for nearly 400 years. They built roads, bathhouses, and sewers.  
  
By the sixth century A.D., German people known as Angles, Jutes, and Saxons were moving into the U.K. The Angles gave their name to England, and English people became known as Anglo-Saxons. From the 900s to the 1400s, England was ruled by Viking, Danish, and Norman invaders. Many different Celtic kingdoms maintained control throughout Ireland and Wales for hundreds of years, and the ancestors of the Picts still ruled over Scotland. From the 900s to the 1400s, England was ruled by Viking, Danish, and Norman invaders. Many different Celtic kingdoms maintained control throughout Ireland and Wales for hundreds of years, and the ancestors of the Picts still ruled over Scotland.

**UNITING THE KINGDOM**  
In the 13th century, England took control of Wales. About 200 years later, in 1485, Welsh noble Henry Tudor claimed the English crown and became Henry VII, the first of five Tudor monarchs. The Welsh territory was officially united with England in 1536.  
  
After many battles to keep its independence, Scotland eventually united with England in 1707. The union of the three nations—England, Wales, and Scotland—became the kingdom of Great Britain, ruled by Queen Anne, who became the first monarch of the newly-formed Great Britain.  
  
The Celts who ruled over Ireland also fought to remain independent from England, which had been invading the country since the late 1100s. By the late 1600s, England had gained control of all of Ireland. Ireland officially became united with England, Scotland, and Wales in 1801, forming the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  
  
**COLONIZATION**  
Eager to find the wealth that [Portugal](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/portugal) and [Spain](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/spain) had found after taking control of other lands, the U.K. began establishing colonies in what would eventually become the [United States](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/united-states). In 1607, Jamestown, in what's now the state of [Virginia](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/states/article/virginia), became the first permanent English settlement in the Americas.  
  
But in the 18th century, American colonists began to rebel against British rule. They fought for their independence during the Revolutionary War, which lasted from 1775 to 1783. The Americans won the war—and their independence.  
  
After the loss of its American colonies, the U.K. shifted its attention to Asia. It established the East India Trading Company to trade in what’s now Indonesia, India, and other parts of southeast Asia. The company’s control of trade in the region eventually led to the colonization of India in 1858.  
  
By the mid-1800s, the United Kingdom was one of the most powerful nations in the world. The country built a huge overseas empire, setting up colonies throughout Africa and even Canada in North America. These colonies were part of the British Empire, which ruled more than one-quarter of the world’s people by the 1900s.  
   
**THE EARLY 20th CENTURY**  
In the late 19th century, [Germany](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/germany) began competing with the U.K. and other European countries to set up colonies in Africa and Asia. These tensions led to World War I in 1914. The United Kingdom—alongside France, [Italy](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/italy), [Japan](https://kids.nationalgeographic.com/geography/countries/article/japan), the United States, and the Soviet Union (now called Russia)—defeated Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire to win the war in 1918.

The United Kingdom spent a lot of money fighting and recovering from World War I and II. Unable to support and oversee its empire, it withdrew from some colonies, allowing them to become independent.

India, often referred to as “the crown jewel of the British Empire,” had been pushing for independence for decades before the world wars. Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi joined the fight in 1914 by encouraging his fellow Indians to engage in nonviolent forms of protest, such as not buying U.K. goods and refusing to pay taxes. Although the struggle for independence sometimes turned violent, Gandhi’s leadership helped India become its own country in 1947.
​
In 1952, Elizabeth II became queen. During her 70-year reign, more than 50 countries that were colonies of the British Empire became independent. This period of history has been called the decolonization of the British Empire.

#### Role of Church in Social Work
In Europe, in the early Christian era, the folk tradition continued and the faithful considered it a **religious obligation to care for those members of the group who could not care for themselves**. Religion provided the greatest motivation for charity. The church, especially the monasteries, became the centres for distributing food, medical aid and shelter. Alms were collected in the parish and distributed by the parish priest and other clergymen who knew the individuals and their situation. 
#### Social work and pre-industrial society
- 1215 King John of England signs the "**Magna Carta**", which establishes some human rights (for the nobility). It is considered a forerunner of modern civil rights law.
- 1348 The social system of feudalism begins to break down, partly because of bubonic plague, which kills nearly one-third of the population of Europe. Without the protection of the barons and lords, the serfs and peasants we are at the mercy of economic and military threats.
- 1531 England’s first statute dealing with poor relief is issued. The statute empowers local justices to license certain people (older and disabled people) to beg in their own neighbourhoods and to give harsh punishment to any unlicensed beggars.
>[!Prior to the 1530’s, churches and monasteries provided hospitals, infirmaries, and almshouses for the old and the sick in the United Kingdom (Cree, 2002). By the mid-1530’s, monasteries were largely closed, and feudal landowners, who had previously provided their tenants with access to farmland, ceased this process, leading to widespread migration away from rural regions. The resulting fears of social disorder led to the passing of the Elizabethan Poor Law Act in 1601.]
##### Features of Elizabethan Poor Law Act, 1601
The Act authorized the raising of taxes to pay for services to those who were poor, needy, and had no family support, assigning them to assistance as follows:
- the ‘impotent poor’ (the aged, chronic sick, blind, and mentally ill who needed residential care) were to be accommodated in voluntary almshouses; 
- the ‘able-bodied’ poor were to be set to work in a workhouse (they were felt to be able to work but were lazy);
- the ‘able-bodied poor’ who ran away or ‘persistent idlers’ who refused to work were to be punished in a ‘house of correction’ (Fraser, 1984, in Cree, 2002:277).
***Principles of Elizabethan Poor Law Act:
1) The principle of the state's responsibility for relief is universally adopted and has never been seriously questioned. It is in tune with democratic philosophy as well as with the principle of the separation of church and state. 
2) The principle of local responsibility for welfare enunciated in the Poor Law goes back to 1388 and is designed to discourage vagrancy. It stipulates that "sturdy beggars" to return to their birthplaces and there seek relief. 
3) A third principle stipulated differential treatment of individuals according to categories: the deserving as against the undeserving poor, children, the aged, and the sick. This principle is based on the theory that certain types of unfortunate people have a grater claim on the community than other types.
4) The Poor Law also delineated family responsibility for aiding dependants. Children, grandchildren, parents, and grandparents were designated as "legally liable" relatives. 
##### The Poor Law Revisions: 1834-1909 
In 1834 a Parliamentary Commission presented a report which aimed to revise the Elizabethan and post-Elizabethan Poor Laws. Upon the basis of the committee's report legislation was enacted enunciating the following principles: 
(a) doctrine of least eligibility, 
(b) re-establishment of the workhouse test, and 
(c) centralization of control. 

The doctrine of least eligibility meant that the condition of paupers shall in no case be so eligible as the condition of persons of the lowest class subsisting on the hits of their own industry. In other words, no person receiving aid was to be as well off.

the able-bodied poor could apply for assistance in the public workhouse, but refusal to accept the lodging and fare of the workhouse debarred them from qualifying for any aid. Outdoor relief was reduced to an absolute minimum. 

As per the third principle, a central authority consisting of three Poor Law Commissioners had power to consolidate and co-ordinate poor law services throughout the land. Parishes were no longer to be the administrative units.

Between 1834 and 1909 there were numerous changes in Poor Law legislation, the cumulative effect of which was to veer the entire system away from the principles of 1834. The most important changes were those that began to develop specialized care for certain disadvantaged groups. For instance, for dependent children district schools and foster homes were provided and for the insane and feeble-minded specialized institutions were started. A more positive approach to the poor laws can be seen in The Poor Law Report of 1909. The report stressed curative treatment and rehabilitation rather than repression, and provision for all in the place of the selective workhouse test. If the principles of 1834 provided a 'framework of repression', those of 1909 may be termed as the 'framework of prevention'. 
#### Octavia Hill (1838–1912): 
It was in 1864 that teacher and artist Octavia Hill (1838-1912) first started to work in the poorer neighbourhoods of late Victorian London (in what is now the borough of Marylebone and nowadays one of the most expensive places to live). She worked with people at the bottom of the social ladder: the poor and unemployed, living in cold and damp dwellings. Housing was her main concern. Hill believed that a well-maintained home, however small, with light, air and space — and with neighbours who care about each other — is one of life’s main necessities.
- Her 1883 publication _The homes of the London poor_ has helped spread her ideas across the world.
- The approach adopted by Octavia Hill and her fellow workers was designed to strengthen the self respect of tenants and to trust in their capabilities. These days, we would call this empowerment and resilience. She hated the kind of philanthropy or charity that creates dependency. She was one of the founding members of the Charity Organisation Society set up in 1869 with the aim of modernising social work to eradicate poverty. Its origins go back to Elberfeld, Germany.
- Octavia Hill is significant in the history of social work because she rejected charitable alms. Her intention was to provide help without alms, arguing that charity tended to be resented and served to keep people on the margins of poverty. Nonetheless, Hill’s approach could be called paternalistic in that it tried to change the attitudes and habits of poor people.
#### Toynbee Hall
Founded in 1884 by Samuel Augustus Barnett and Dame Henrietta Barnett. The settlement movement began with the founding of Toynbee Hall in London.
- invited a number of university students to join him and his wife in “settling” in a deprived area of the city.
- 
>[! Arnold Toynbee, born August 23, 1852, London, England—died March 9, 1883, Wimbledon]
>Toynbee was also a practical social reformer. He encouraged the development of trade unions and lectured to working-class audiences in large industrial cities. His interest in and desire to help Britain’s growing numbers of poor led him into a close association with the poor working-class district of Whitechapel in East London, a pioneering social settlement in East London. Toynbee died after suffering a complete breakdown in health owing to overwork.

#### Mary Stewart (1864–1957)

an official distributor of alms
#### Social Security
- The 1908 and 1948 Olympic years were landmarks in the development of Britain's social security system.
- -The 1908 old-Age Pensions Act introduced the state pension, while 1948 saw the launch of the comprehensive system of social security recommended by the Beveridge report of 1942
#### Child Protection
- A legislation to prosecute people accused of child cruelty has been in force since the 1880s
- 1946 – Curtis committee and Clyde committee
The Care of Children Committee, led by Dame Myra Curtis, investigated and made recommendations about how care was provided for children who weren’t able to live with their own parents or relatives in England and Wales.

- James L. Clyde led the Committee on Homeless Children in Scotland, which had a similar remit.
- The recommendations of both committees contributed to the development of the 1948 Children Act.
- 1948 – Children Act: Under the Act, local authorities had a duty to provide care for any child whose parents were unable to care for them, if this was in the child’s best interests.
- The Children Act 1975 built on the 1945 Act and highlighted the importance of children’s welfare. It also established the role of an independent social worker who would ensure the best interests of the child during court proceedings.
#### The Beveridge Report 
This was Sir William Beveridge’s clarion call to Parliament to establish a comprehensive system of social insurance for Britain’s population in his report Social Insurance and Allied Services, better known as the Beveridge Report, which was presented to Parliament on 24 November 1942 and has its 75th anniversary this year.

His report, officially entitled _Social Insurance and Allied Services_, was a key part of the plans to rebuild and improve Britain after the war had ended.
As a result of this research, he declared that there were five giants on the road to reconstruction. These were:
==want – an adequate income for all==
==disease – access to health care==
==ignorance – a good education==
==squalor – adequate housing==
==idleness – gainful employment==
To help make a better Britain and to tackle these five ‘evil giants’, he proposed setting up a welfare state.

In 1942, Sir William Beveridge, chairman of the Inter-Departmental Committee on Social Insurance and Allied Services, presented the Committee's Report to the government. The report emphasized four major principles: 
1) Every citizen to be covered, 
2) The major risks of loss of earning power - sickness, unemployment, accident, old age, widowhood, maternity- to be included in a single insurance, 
3) A flat rate of contribution to be paid regardless of the contributor's income, and 
4) A flat rate of benefit to be paid, also without regard to income, as a right 'to all 'who qualify. 
Beveridge emphasized that the underlined social philosophy of his plan was to secure the British against want and other social evils. Everyone is entitled to benefits, which include maternity, sickness, unemployment, industrial injury, retirement and grant for widows. The related services are;
>[!Family Allowances,]

>[! National Health Services ]

>[!National Assistance]

The Beveridge Report of 1942 takes its place as one of the great documents in English Poor Law history - 1601,1834,1909, and 1942. The Report became the foundation of the modem social welfare legislation for UK.
- ##### Beginnings of the COS Movement and Settlement House Movement 
##### Gay Rights
The year 1988 was something of a ‘watershed’ in the UK history of lesbian and gay foster care and adoption for a number of reasons. Although a few lesbians and gay men had been successful in their fostering or adoption applications, many of them had not ‘come out’ about their sexuality and so the practice was largely hidden from view (see, for example, Brennan, 1994). In 1988, however, Skeates and Jabri produced their report on fostering and adoption by lesbians and gay men, the first ever UK publication to deal with this issue (Skeates and Jabri, 1988).
##### UK Philosopher and their ideological contribution in Social Work
