## TL;DR

Two well-documented Indian cases useful for MSW teaching are agrarian distress after trade liberalization and the political ecology of urban waste recyclers; both illustrate clear positive and negative social outcomes and link cleanly to sectoral policy shifts and labour effects.

## Agrarian transformations and farmer impacts

The agrarian economy shows clear, teachable contrasts between productivity gains and structural harms tied to liberalization, making it a core case for MSW students. Use policy-change timelines and household-level impacts to link macro reforms to individual wellbeing.

- **Context and mechanisms** Global policy shifts removed quantitative import restrictions and reduced public investment in rural infrastructure and extension services, altering price supports and institutional credit structures and undermining national research systems [1].  
- **Negative impacts** These changes correlate with rising input costs, reduced public services, weakened rural credit and social-provision systems, and increased vulnerability for smallholders [1], [2].  
- **Positive or ambiguous effects** Market access and technology diffusion produce productivity gains for some farmers, but benefits are uneven and mediated by asset ownership and state support [1].  
- **Classroom activity** Assign students to analyse a post-1991 policy timeline, map impacts on a hypothetical village household, and propose social policy responses (rural credit reform, PDS strengthening, extension services).

## Urban informal work and waste recycling

Informal recyclers in Indian cities provide a concrete, localised study of globalization’s mixed effects on livelihoods, urban governance, and environmental policy. MSW students can explore dignity, exclusion, and policy negotiations through this urban lens.

- **Empirical focus** Studies of municipal solid waste systems in Delhi document how neoliberal restructuring and municipal reforms reshape recycling practices and labour conditions for informal recyclers [4].  
- **Negative impacts** Informal recyclers face insecure livelihoods, exclusion from formal green-job initiatives, and precarious working conditions as municipal systems are reconfigured [4].  
- **Positive openings** The circular-economy framing creates policy entry points for recognition, upskilling and linkage to formal value chains, potentially improving incomes and environmental outcomes if inclusion is prioritized [4].  
- **Classroom activity** Run a stakeholder-mapping exercise where students role-play recyclers, municipal officials, and NGO advocates to negotiate inclusion in formal waste contracts.

## Industry and IT sectoral effects

Sectoral reregulation after liberalization produced divergent outcomes across IT and manufacturing, offering rich comparative cases to teach structural policy impacts on employment and social welfare. Use sectoral analyses to show how the same macro-policy can yield sector-specific social dynamics.

- **Policy pattern** India’s liberalization strategy liberalized FDI and then reregulated selectively by sector, producing different institutional trajectories for IT, manufacturing and other industries [5].  
- **Social outcomes** Sectoral openness facilitated rapid growth and employment in some industries (notably export-oriented and skill-intensive sectors) while manufacturing and labour-intensive segments showed mixed reregulation, displacement, and uneven labour protections [5], [3].  
- **Teaching angle** Compare a skill-intensive sector case with a labour-intensive manufacturing case to discuss differential social protection needs, retraining, and migration pressures [5], [3].  
- **Classroom activity** Have students construct comparative policy briefs recommending social-protection measures tailored to sectoral labour profiles (e.g., training, portable benefits).

## Practical classroom case design

Design MSW modules that combine policy analysis, community narratives, and participatory methods to highlight positive and negative globalization effects. Each suggested activity is implementable without requiring new large datasets.

- **Case selection** Combine the agrarian policy case [1] and the urban recyclers case [4] with one sectoral comparison using reregulation literature [5] to cover rural, urban, and industrial domains.  
- **Method mix** Use a blend of document analysis, simulated stakeholder negotiations, community mapping, and short field immersions; emphasise ethical engagement and reflexivity.  
- **Assessment ideas** Evaluate students on policy memos proposing social-welfare interventions, reflective journals from field encounters, and group presentations that synthesize micro-level impacts with macro policy drivers.  
- **Learning outcomes** Aim for students to link structural policy changes to individual and community wellbeing, design context-sensitive interventions, and advocate for inclusive governance.
