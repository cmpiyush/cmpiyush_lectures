#### Background
##### Imperialism, Colonialism and Neo-colonialism
- For Edward Said (1993)"Imperialism means the practice, the theory, and the attitude of a dominating metropolitan centre ruling a distant territory" whereas "colonialism, which is almost always a consequences of imperialism, is the implanting of settlement on distant territory" (Gauba, 2009)
- J.A. Hobson(Imperialism; 1902) defined imperialism as a search for 'captive market'.
- V.I. Lenin (Imperialism: The highest Stage of Capitalism): "Imperialism was an economic necessity of capitalist economy". Because, the large capital accumulation need avenues for investment, new market and new sources of raw materials.
- Foreign trade allows capitalists to secure a higher rate of return than that available at home.
- *"Neo-colonisation denotes the strategy of a colonial power which does not maintain its political domination in a foreign territory, but continues its economic exploitation by using it as a source of cheap labour and raw material as well as big market for its industrial products."* (p.193)
- To negotiate with capitalist economy, countries had to make international cooperation Ex: Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC, 1960)
-  Chile, Brazil, Panama and other latin American countries continued to be raw material supplier to the North America.
##### Power Blocs
- After second world war, world was divided into two big ideological camps; Capitalistic camp led by USA and Communist camp led by USSR
- NATO-1949
- Warsaw Pact- 1955 countries from west Europe
- Countries got independence called 'Third World' by Alfred Sauvy (1898-1990)
- Non-align: India, Egypt and Yugoslavia
##### Impact of the Power Blocs
- Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles, military insecurity
- Mikhail Gorbachev reform in 1985: Collapse of Communist System 
- Base of domination is shifting from military power to economic power.
#### Process of Globalisation
- Primacy of economic issue
- USA, Western Europe and Japan had become dependent on foreign source of energy
- Western Europe decided to create a single European Common Market
- Third world countries were growing under a heavy debt burden. Not much economic development.
