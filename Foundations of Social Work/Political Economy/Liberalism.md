#### Background
- Fall of feudalism
- Emergence of middle class
- Enlightenment 
#### Liberalism (*Udaarwad*)
- The word liberal is derived from the Latin word liber which means free men Liberalist is also a derivative of liber. The central idea of all these words is freedom or liberty. Liberal also denotes generosity or open-mindedness. Open mindedness/generosity indicate liberty in taking food, drink, social attitude, behaviour and selection of the alternatives.

- In the middle Ages when the French people used the word liber they meant that people will have freedom in respect of their selection of alternatives and pursuit of thoughts and ideas.

-  Liberalism focuses on the idea of individual liberty

- Liberalism as a political and moral philosophy which is centred on two main principles - these are individualism and liberty. Firstly, liberalism places the individual at the heart of society and argues that the highest value social order is one that is built around the individual. Secondly, the purpose of society is to allow individuals to reach their full potential if they want to, and that the best way to do this is to give the individual as much liberty as possible. These two key principles are the foundations upon which the various elements of liberalism spring forth.

- liberalism bestowed importance on the idea of human reason. It believes that all individuals are rational creatures. Hence, they are in a better position to decide what is for their own good. It is precisely because human beings are driven by the logic of reason that they have a tendency to cooperate with one another, especially in areas where they have common interest. Such cooperation can occur both domestically and internationally

**Definition**
“It means the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual’s rights and to maximise freedom of choice” (Oxford Concise Dictionary of Politics)
-  political to (1) Freedom and choice
-  (2) Liberalism is a systematic political creed
- It is the manifestation of reason and toleration in the face of tradition and absolutism.
- Freedom, equality, liberty etc. are embodied in the liberalism.
-  Robert Eccleshall in his noted article Liberalism has stated that liberalism-in ultimate analysis- is a political ideology intimately associated with the birth and evolution of the capitalist world.
- So we can say that as a political ideology liberalism means to pursue policies of freedom in political and economic spheres and clear restrictions on the activities of state authority.
#### Proponents of Liberalism
- John Locke (1632-1704) 
	- reason is necessary for arriving at truth and right action. 
	- Reason is necessary for understanding and shaping nature and society. 
	- human beings are capable of shaping their destiny.
- John Locke – such as the **social agreement, natural rights** and **tolerance** – reflected the new ideas of a period known as the **starting place of liberal thinking**. 
- Richard Price wrote how the **French revolutionists** were spreading and developing the liberal principles mentioned by Locke a century earlier.
- He argued that government should rule by the consent of the governed. 
- Locke argued the case of limited government. The main responsibility of the government is to protect the rights and liberties of its citizens.
- Adam Smith (1776) believed in the idea of ‘economic man’. Smith believed that if every individual tries to maximize their self-interest, it will lead to overall economic prosperity in the society. Smith coined the term laissez faire economy. According to this idea, the market the state shall not interfere in the activities of the market. Smith visualized that a free market can bring about overall national prosperity.
- Bentham introduced the concept of the ‘greatest happiness of the greatest number’. Thus, individuals should focus on those activities which maximizes pleasure and minimizes pain. Bentham also proposed that there should be an international court. The spirit of Bentham’s idea can be observed in the structures and functions of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) (Sutch and Elias 2010).
- Some liberal theorists, following David Ricardo ((1772-1823) and Richard Cobden (1804-65), champion free trade as increasing interdependence among states reduces the likelihood of war. They reject mercantilism which regarded economic growth and war as compatible goals. Liberals argue that free trade is preferable to mercantilism as trade produces wealth without war. (Interdependence liberalism).
- Liberal theorists are pluralists as well. They believe that state is only one actor both in within a society and on the international stage. They challenge the realist assumption that states are the only actors in international politics. Liberals argue that there are many actors in world politics which play a vital role in influencing international outcomes. The liberal tradition highlights the importance of nonstate actors such as MNCs and NGOs.
-  liberal theorists focus on state-society linkages and claim the existence of a close connection between domestic institutions and politics on the one hand and the international politics on the other.

- Negative rights| Positive rights
- _Laissez-faire_ economy | Economic control
#### Modern Liberalism
By the 1880s, some liberalists wanted a change of direction, reconsidering some of the Classical Liberalism arguments. The backdrop was the further development of industrial capitalism during the second half of the 19th century. Some in society had successfully become wealthy due to the Industrial Revolution. At the same time, there were serious social issues. Poverty, illness, a lack of education and difficult working conditions were seen. Due to these issues, a number of liberalists struggled to defend some of the classical ideas. They began to question whether the state should intervene in fields such as education, working conditions and healthcare to help individuals. Augmenting this discussion were the socialist ideas and the connection between politics and social and economic problems.
- Modern liberalism developed from the social-liberal tradition, which focused on 
	- impediments to individual freedom—including poverty and inequality, disease, discrimination, and ignorance
	- that had been created or exacerbated by unfettered capitalism and could be ameliorated only through direct state intervention. 
	- Such measures began in the late 19th century with workers’ compensation schemes, the public funding of schools and hospitals, and regulations on working hours and conditions and eventually, by the mid-20th century, encompassed the broad range of social services and benefits characteristic of the so-called welfare state.
#### Neo-liberalism
"The term was first coined in post-World War I Germany by a small circle of economists and
legal scholars affiliated with the ‘Freiburg School’ to refer to their moderate programme of reviving classical liberalism." (Steger & Roy, 2010)
- Philosophically it repudiates the deterministic outlook of human life and maintains that human personality, character, thoughts and actions cannot be constructed as the outcome of his circumstances.
- Welfare state inimical to individual liberty, as it involved the forced transfer of resources from the more competent to the less competent.
- To restore liberty, it is required to revive the principle of *laissez-faire* not only in economic sphere, but also in social and political sphere.
- Neo-liberalism seeks his liberation from all institutions which tend to restrict his vision of the world, including the institutions of religion, family and customs of social conformity apart from political institutions.
- Neoliberalism, ideology and policy model that emphasizes the value of free market competition.
- Neoliberalism is distinct from modern liberalism. Both have their ideological roots in the classical liberalism of the 19th century, which championed economic laissez-faire and the freedom (or liberty) of individuals against the excessive power of government. 
- That variant of liberalism is often associated with the economist Adam Smith, who argued in _The Wealth of Nations_ (1776) that markets are governed by an “invisible hand” and thus should be subject to minimal government interference.
- All neo-liberals believe in the primacy of the 'spontaneous order' of human relationship as exemplified in free markets.
- Neo-liberal deplore any politics which pretends to have definitive knowledge of human needs.
- They believe, human needs manifest themselves through the myriad unpredictable transactions between individuals living in a free or open society.
- Regulations on these activities curtails their freedom without fulfilling their genuine needs.
- In the economic sphere, market exemplifies genuine democracy.
