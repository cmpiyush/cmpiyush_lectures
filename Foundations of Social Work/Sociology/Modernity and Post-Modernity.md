#### Modernity 
- Poststructuralism involves the abandonment of the idea that there is an overall, rationalised order to social thought and progress in social development, it moves beyond modernity and becomes postmodernity. 
- The poststructuralists have been concerned to provide arguments as to why the modernist **conception**, or the Enlightenment project, as they prefer to call it, **cannot be sustained, to show how it is unsustainable relative to the historical developments of the modern period**, and to formulate alternative conceptions. 
#### Post-modernity
 Modernism was the product of the industrial era when the traditional method of explanation and expression got replaced by ‘reason’ and ‘science’. The fundamental attributes of reason and science are to formulate grand narratives and theories. 
 - Postmodernism emerged as a radical alternative to modernity. It argues that modernism is too centralized and monolithic in nature and so it suppresses the minor identities and voices. 
 - It rejects the notion of a single meaning of truth. 
 - It challenges the various established and settled assumptions pertaining to society, culture and the nature of knowledge. 
 - It corroded the fundamental foundations of epistemology in general and the practices of social sciences in particular. It advocates multiplicity of narratives and refutes the possibility of meta-narratives.
- Postmodernism is a style of thought which is suspicious of classical notions of truth, reason, identity and objectivity, of the ideas of universal progress or emancipation, of single frameworks, grand narratives or ultimate grounds of explanation. 
- Against these enlightenment norms, it sees the world as contingent, ungrounded, diverse, unstable, indeterminate, a set of disunited cultures or interpretations which breed a degree of skepticism about the objectivity of truth, history and norms, the ‘givenness’ of natures and the coherence of identities. 
- Key postmodern thinkers: Lyotard, Derrida and Foucault, Laclou and Mouffe.

If we are moving beyond modernity, we are not merely moving beyond a particular intellectual outlook. Rather, we must be moving beyond the particular historical period (or epoch) in which the notions of modernity were thinkable into one in which those notions are no longer thinkable, i.e. a postmodern age. 

* Postmodernity refers to a social and political epoch that is generally seen as following the modern era in a historical sense (Kumar, 1995; Crook, Pakulski, and Waters, 1992).
* Postmodernism refers to cultural products (in art, movies, architecture, and so on) that are seen as different from modern cultural products (Kumar, 1995; Jameson, 1991).
* Postmodern social theory refers to a kind of social theory that is distinct from modern social theory (Best and Kellner, 1991).
* Thus, the idea of the postmodern encompasses a new historical epoch, new cultural products, and a new type of theorizing about the social world.
#### Lyotard on the postmodern era
Jean Francois Lyotard, the French political philosopher and cultural critic, is one of the most influential figures of postmodern philosophy. His book The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge is considered a Bible of Postmodernism and supplies a coherent conceptualization of it.

Jean-François Lyotard (b. 1924) begins his analysis of contemporary post World War II society from observations about the way the changing structure of economic production has transformed the position of knowledge, especially as a result of the rise of the computer.
- Information age: in which knowledge will itself become a productive force, perhaps the predominant productive force.
>[! Knowledge as a commodity]
Not only does knowledge become a productive force, it also increasingly 
becomes a commodity, i.e. something produced for the purpose of sale. 
Knowledge as something to be instilled in the human mind is being 
displaced by the idea that it is something to be sold.
- The expansion of the economy has become an end in itself, quite independent of any of the standards by which we might otherwise seek to judge things. Usually we do not desire to judge things only by standards of efficiency; there are other standards such as moral goodness, beauty and fairness. Science, however, knows nothing of these things, and scientific knowledge is, of course, a driving force of the economy. 
- On this argument, it follows that if there is to be knowledge of what is good, beautiful and fair, it cannot be scientific knowledge. If such knowledge is to be found, it cannot be within the forms that scientific knowledge can take. It must take a different form, which Lyotard dubs 'narrative'.
>[! Narrative]
In traditional societies, narrative is the common, predominant form within which knowledge is conveyed. Lyotard asserts that knowledge of different kinds can be transmitted through stories. In these traditional societies the role of narrative is functional; it subserves and contributes to the needs of social solidarity.

- By contrast, the modern or postmodern form of contemporary society is made up of isolated, atomistic, instrumentally connected individuals. It results from the dissolution of the social solidarity of traditional societies, a process which is effected through the rise of the way of thought characteristically dubbed rationalist and pre-eminently embodied in science, i.e. it requires logical, formal demonstrative reasoning sustained by empirical truth. 
- In short, it requires theoretical structures, not stories. Narrative does not traffic in argument and proof and cannot therefore satisfy scientific standards. Rather than recognising narrative as signifying a different kind of knowledge.
- However, those enamoured of scientific standards disvalue it, denouncing it as a form of archaic or impoverished thought, e.g. as primitive thought or mere opinion. 
- Whoever controls such knowledge now exerts political control. 
- Knowledge will become a source of conflict between nations in future and therefore, future wars will be fought over access to information, not over territory or ideology. 
- He holds that the dominance of such power oriented knowledge in postmodern era signifies the collapse of universal emancipatory project of modernity (enlightenment). 
- He further insists that knowledge is neither scientific nor totally value-free in that it is dependent on narratives — the ways in which the world is understood through the stories we tell about it. 
- For gaining legitimacy. He rejects the totalizing tendencies of history and society; what he calls “grand narratives” like Marxism.
- scientific standards are not, and cannot be, self-justifying with respect to such qualities as moral goodness, beauty and fairness because scientific discourse explicitly excludes narrative discourse, the only form of language that can provide such justifications. Any legitimisation for scientific discourse must, however, be drawn from narrative forms; indeed, they illicitly and surreptitiously (but inevitably) must intrude. 
- Ironically, then, science cannot do without stories; the task of stories is to provide justification and legitimisation to science. 
#### Critique of Post modernism
- Roy D’Andrade (1931-2016)- D’Andrade argues that despite the fact that utterly value-free objectivity is impossible, it is the goal of the anthropologist to get as close as possible to that ideal.
- He states that objectivity is in no way dehumanizing nor is objectivity impossible. He states, “Science works not because it produces unbiased accounts but because its accounts are objective enough to be proved or disproved no matter what anyone wants to be true.”
- Patricia M. Greenfield : **Greenfield believes that postmodernism’s complete lack of objectivity, and its tendency to push political agendas, makes it virtually useless in any scientific** investigation (Greenfield 2005)
- Christopher Norris – Norris believes that **Lyotard, Foucault, and Baudrillard are too preoccupied with the idea of the primacy of moral judgments**. (Norris 1990: 50).
- Spiro critically addresses six interrelated propositions from John Searle’s 1993 work, “Rationality and Realism”(“Postmodernism and Its Critics,” 2017)
	- Reality exists independently of human representations. If this is true then, contrary to postmodernism, this postulate supports the existence of “mind-independent external reality” which is called “metaphysical realism”.
	- Language communicates meanings but also refers to objects and situations in the world which exist independently of language. Contrary to postmodernism, this postulate supports the concept of language as have communicative and referential functions.
	- Statements are true or false depending on whether the objects and situations to which they refer correspond to a greater or lesser degree to the statements. This “correspondence theory” of truth is to some extent the theory of truth for postmodernists, but this concept is rejected by many postmodernists as “essentialist.”
	- Knowledge is objective. This signifies that the truth of a knowledge claim is independent of the motive, culture, or gender of the person who makes the claim. Knowledge depends on empirical support.
	- Logic and rationality provide a set of procedures and methods, which contrary to postmodernism, enables a researcher to assess competing knowledge claims through proof, validity, and reason.
	- Objective and intersubjective criteria judge the merit of statements, theories, interpretations, and all accounts.
