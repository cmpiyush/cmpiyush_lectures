#### Post-independence development
- America fought revolutionary war and got independence in 1776. A peace treaty was signed in 1783.
- 1787: The U.S. Constitution is adopted to “promote the general welfare”, moving social welfare into American political discourse.

- 1874: The first Charity Organization Society is established, at first giving only advice, and not direct financial aid to the needy.
> [!Charity Organization Societies (COS) were originally developed to bring order and organization to the extensive private and religious responses to the disadvantaged (Bernard, 1995). The philosophy was to give everyone a chance to be able to stand on their own, with those requesting aid being classified by the volunteers as either deserving or undeserving, based on whether they were judged as being willing to help themselves. As has proven true over time in efforts to mount social work responses, it was often been the “economically fortunate who volunteered to ‘rehabilitate’ the poor through the power of personal influence”(1995: 8). ]
***

>[! Mary Ellen Richmond was one of the first social workers to push for the professionalization and standardization of social work. She is credited with creating the first statement of principles for direct social work practice and is most famous for her speech at the 1897 National Conference of Charities and Correction, where she implored schools to train social workers, calling for standardization in the social work field. Her book Social Diagnosis was one of the first social work books to incorporate scientific principles from law, medicine, psychology, psychiatry and history.]

#### Conclusion:

>[! Van Wormer (2003: 162), drawing on Specht and Courtney’s 1994, "Unfaithful Angels: How Social Work Has Abandoned Its Mission", acknowledged that arrangements for dealing with the poor that emerged after the feudal but before the modern era could be classified as “the four Ps”: Patronage, Piety, Poor laws, and Philanthropy. ]

- Patronage involved boosting one segment of society, 
- Piety was the religious aspect of serving the needy, often as an expression of moral duty,
- The Poor Laws, reflecting the imposition of middle class values and standards of character on the needy were, according to Specht and Courtney, both “mean spirited and means tested”, and often clouded with undesirable or stigmatizing associations
- Private philanthropy involved voluntary financial donations as a preferred alternative to mandatory public relief.
