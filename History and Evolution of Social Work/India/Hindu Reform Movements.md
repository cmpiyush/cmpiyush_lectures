#### Understanding Gandhi
- Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (1869-1948) was born in Porbandar Gujarat.
- His father was a *Dewan* of Porbandar under British suzerainty
- His mother was religious.
- "Mohandas grew up in a home steeped in Vaishnavism—worship of the Hindu god Vishnu—with a strong tinge of Jainism, a morally rigorous Indian religion whose chief tenets are nonviolence and the belief that everything in the universe is eternal". 
- "Thus, he took for granted ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings), vegetarianism, fasting for self-purification, and mutual tolerance between adherents of various creeds and sects."
- he would have liked to have been a doctor. But, besides the Vaishnava prejudice against vivisection.
- During his time in England, Gandhi encountered diverse individuals, particularly within vegetarian circles.
- These connections introduced him to the Bible and, significantly, to the Bhagavadgita, which he read in English translation for the first time.
- The English vegetarians he met were a varied group, including socialists, humanitarians, Fabians, and Theosophists.
- Many of these individuals were idealists and rebels who challenged Victorian societal norms, critiquing capitalism and industrialism.
- They advocated for a simpler life, prioritizing moral values over material ones, and cooperation over conflict.
- These ideas profoundly shaped Gandhi's personal development and later influenced his political philosophy.
- Gandhi Ji came back to India from London in July 1891 and tried to get into job. However, he failed as legal profession were already crowded.
- In 1893, He got an opportunity to work as Barrister in Natal South Africa.
- In 1894 he founded the Natal Indian Congress, of which he himself became the secretary.
- Through that common political organization, he infused a spirit of solidarity in the heterogeneous Indian community
- In 1903 he started a weekly paper, *Indian Opinion*.
- Increasingly interested in a communal life of self-supporting simplicity and inspired both by Trappist monasteries and John Ruskin’s book ***"Unto This Last***".
- The Trappist monks had a deep impact on Gandhi’s striving to create and nurture a community devoted to truth and non-violence, seeking freedom and moksha.(Thinking with Hands, 2022)
- Gandhi's experiences in South African jails, which often involved 'hard labour', also profoundly impacted him.
- This exposure to hard labour fundamentally altered his views on food, sleep, and work, making physical labour an obligatory practice in his life.
- The following year he bought some 100 acres (40ha) near Phoenix station and there founded a community that he called Phoenix, and he moved the newspaper operations to the new settlement.
- Gandhi faced immediate racial discrimination upon arriving in South Africa.
- He was asked to remove his turban in court, which he refused.
- He was forcibly removed from a first-class train compartment.
- He was physically assaulted by a stagecoach driver for not giving up his seat.
- He was denied access to hotels designated 'for Europeans only'.
- While such humiliations were common for Indians, Gandhi's strong reaction was unique.
- These experiences became a pivotal moment for him, leading him to commit to fighting injustice and defending his dignity.
- He stayed in South Africa for 20 years.
- Shrimad Rajchandra, a Jain philosopher, served as Gandhi's spiritual mentor.
- Rajchandra helped Gandhi understand the depth of Hinduism, his birth religion.
- The Bhagavad-Gita, which Gandhi first read in London, became a pivotal text for him, acting as his 'spiritual dictionary'.
- Two Sanskrit words from the Gita profoundly influenced Gandhi:
    - 'Aparigraha' (nonpossession) encouraged him to shed material attachments that hinder spiritual growth.
    - 'Samabhava' (equability) taught him to maintain composure amidst life's highs and lows, and to work without attachment to outcomes.
    These philosophical tenets were central to shaping Gandhi's worldview and his approach to life and activism.
##### Sarvodaya:
- The work of John Ruskin’s "unto the last " influenced him so much that when he translated the book he gave the book name "Sarvodaya".
- Sarvodaya is the word comes from Jain literatures of Acharya Samantabhadra.
- The idea resolute with shloka in Hindu religion
> **सर्वे भवन्तु सुखिनः (सभी सुखी हों):**
सभी लोगों को सुख प्राप्त हो। 
**सर्वे सन्तु निरामयाः (सभी रोगमुक्त रहें):**
सभी लोग रोगों से मुक्त रहें और स्वस्थ रहें। 
**सर्वे भद्राणि पश्यन्तु (सभी मंगलमय घटनाओं को देखें):**
सभी के लिए मंगल और शुभ हो, और सभी शुभ चीजों के साक्षी बनें। 
**मा कश्चित् दुःखभाग्भवेत् (कोई भी दुःख का भागी न बने):**
किसी भी व्यक्ति को दुख का अनुभव न हो या किसी को भी दुःख का भागी न बनना पड़े।

- Gandhi used the word to describe the principles that he felt should guide us in our effort to build ourselves, our families, our communities, and nations.
- He had arrived at these principles of a Sarvodaya Society on the basis of his studies, his observations and his experiments with truth and non-violence.
- He felt very strongly that the soundest foundation on which societies should be built were the qualities of truth, love and compassion in both our personal and public lives.
###### Spiritual Basis of Sarvodaya
- Participation of all kind of people irrespective of class, caste, creed, and religion.
- It also stands for the total blossoming of all the faculties- Physical, mental and spiritual of the human being.
- The base philosophy is commonness.
- Self Scarify
