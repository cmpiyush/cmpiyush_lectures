#### Conclusion
- "The origins of social work in India are rooted in the humanitarian and altruistic ideals, which took the shape of voluntary work or religious pursuits to help the poor and needy. While these trends continue to inﬂuence social work practice in India, the emergence of professional social work has struck a chord for a more radical and action-oriented social work practice". (Palattiyil & Sidhva, 2012)
- As a practice, professional social work in India is embedded in the values of equality, worth, and dignity of all people; is motivated by the aspirations for human rights and social justice; and strives to alleviate poverty and empower marginalised and oppressed people in order to realise their true potential. 
- The National Association of Social Worker’s Code of Practice, there has been a fundamental shift towards indigenising social work –appreciating the cultural differences and societal values that the Indian psyche is accustomed to.
