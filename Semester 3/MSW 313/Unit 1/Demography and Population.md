#### Unit -1: Demography and population- Meaning; Sources of demographic data: Census, Vital registration, National Sample Survey, Sample Registration Scheme.
##### Demography
Demography word comes from the Greek word 'Demos' (δῆμος) meaning people or population and 'graphy' (γραφία) means meaning "description" or "writing about".
Thus, demographic analysis focuses on the study of the components of the population variation and change. Studies quantitative relationship among demographic phenomena.
##### Population Studies
Population studies, often used as a synonyms of demography, is a broad study of population in the field of social science. It covers the interdisciplinary relationship of the population with social, economic, political, biological, genetics, geographical and the like.

Warren S. Thompson: Population studies should concern with:
1. changes in the size of the population
2. how these changes are brought about and,
3. What is the significance of change from human welfare/social welfare standpoint.

So, demography is concerned with its size or numbers, its structure and characteristics, its distribution and the changes taking place in it over a period of time.
- Demographic variables: Birth/Fertility, Death/Mortality and Migration/Immigration
- Population structure: age and sex structure of the population
- Population Characteristics: Marital Status, Literacy and education status, labour force status etc.
- Characteristic of population changes with social mobility such as marriage, changes in occupation etc. and through demographic variables as well.

Whereas Population studies is concerned with social, economic, political and other influences on population and vice-versa.

However, it is difficult to define a clear boundaries between Demography and Population Studies. Demographic analysis would not have any meaning if not framed from the inter-disciplinary field. Similarly, without demographic data and analysis population studies could not reliable.
