- _Projection of the population_
- _Comparison of the progress_
- Different take on defining mortality particularly a child

#### Source of Data
- Death registration
- Hospital
- Mor
#### Limitation of Mortality Data
- Unreliable when large scale mortality happens due to war or epidemic

#### Mortality Rate
##### 1. Crude Death Rate
$$ CDR = \frac {D}{P} $$
Where;
_D= Deaths registered in a year
P= Population of an area in that year $$ P = P_{1} +{1/2}{(P_{2}}-{P_{1})}$$
K= 100000_
###### Advantage
- It becomes possible to reduce the death rate into one figure only
- It is very easy and can be understood by common man
###### Disadvantage
- Extreme cases are adversely affect the rate
- Difficult to get reliable mortality data
#### 2. Age Specific Death Rate

#### 3. Standardised or Adjusted Death Rate
#### 4. Infant Death Rate
Infant Mortality Rate measures the risk of dying during the first year of life. Probability of a dying for an infant within a year of its birth.
$$ IMR =\frac {D_{0}}{B}X1000$$
#### 5. Cause specific Death Rate
