# Challenges of Social Work as a Profession, 
### Challenges and Identity Issues:
• **Struggle for Professional Status:** Social workers have historically struggled to establish themselves as a profession, facing challenges in defining their identity and how others perceive them.
**• Diverse Roles:** The variety of roles (caseworkers, community workers, activists, policy analysts, administrators) makes it challenging to integrate diverse views into a clear professional definition.
**• Societal Ambivalence:** Society's ambivalence towards social work, rooted in humanitarianism but hesitant to shift power/resources, has hindered a clear mandate for publicly funded services.
**• Professional Boundary Issues:** The dual focus on individual/group functioning and social policies has led to persistent professional boundary and identity issues.
**• Broad Scope and Specialization:** The vast scope of knowledge and skills, along with increasing specialization, can threaten the unity of the profession if there is no coherent classification scheme.
**• Cause vs. Function Debate:** Fluctuation in emphasis between "cause or function," "environmental reform or individual change," and "social treatment or direct service" has resulted in a "confusing identity".
**• Debate on Professional Criteria:** Scholars have debated for decades whether social work fully meets criteria like those proposed by Flexner and Greenwood.
**• Indigenization in India:** In India, there has been a shift toward meeting social development needs, with less attention to casework, and a need for culturally relevant, preventive, and macro-based practice.
• **Future Challenges:** Future challenges include identifying new needs, political social work in times of limited resources, intense needs of vulnerable populations, increased demand for health/mental health services, and disparities in access to care.
• **Globalization Concerns:** Concerns exist about whether social work truly remains at the centre of addressing poverty and exclusion globally, or if it functions predominantly with a Western cultural orientation influenced by free market forces.
• **"Unintegrated Professional Identity":** Including all types of practice under the social work rubric has resulted in an unintegrated professional identity, though common objectives (social change, problem-solving, empowerment) based on shared values and ethics hold the profession together.
# Interface between Professional and Voluntary Social Work
1.	 Voluntary work could be extended to an individual too, but when it addresses the needs of a community at large, it is referred to as voluntary social work. Professional work implies all that is done for a profit and based on skill and core competency areas.
2.	 Professionalism:
- Paid, as opposed to unpaid or voluntary or amateur
- A member of a specific expert work community, as opposed to a non-professional group.
3.	 Professional and voluntary work are different in the targets set.
- The professional and voluntary workers are both driven by the incessant urge to contribute positively to society.
- Both the spheres of influence encompass humanity at large.
4.	Both forms of social work include doing some sort of work that benefits the society.
- It could be anything from taking care of the elderly in old folks’ homes, to work next to underprivileged school children and their families
5.	 Professional social work is done by those who do it for a living, and usually follow the same 8-hour-work a day, or 40-hour-work a week calendar like other professionals in other fields of work. Professional social workers are required to be trained and qualified for the work they do in the community, such as teaching, etc.
