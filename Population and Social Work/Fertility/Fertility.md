#### Developed Countries
##### Desired for Planned Family
##### High Living Standard
- According to Sadler, Doubleday and Spencer (): Use protein in good quality which reduces fertility rate.
- social capillarity theory of Dumont: People attained high living standard do not wish to bring that down and as such these people keep fertility rate low.
- Death rate
- Leibenstein Theory: Fertility rate is always kept low by the people with high living standard because
##### Urbanisation
Less space, high cost of living.
##### Education among the women
They are educated to take decision on child on their own.
##### Non-Dependence on Men
Women are not dependent on men. Socially and politically these have their own rights.
##### Awakening among women
Women cannot be forced for birth. They are aware of their rights.
##### Decreasing influence of Religion

##### Emotional need of Children

#### Developing
##### Early and child marriage
##### Poverty
##### Religious and social Value
##### Lack of female education
##### Less social Awakening
##### No desire for high living standard
##### Agriculture as main occupation
##### High Death Rate
##### Difficulties in family planning programme
##### Less Urbanisation
##### Less expensive Bringing up

#### Fertility Rate
##### 1. Child-Women Ratio
 $$Child-Women Ratio = \frac{Children of the age less than 5 Years}{Women of reproduction age group}*1000 $$
$$ Child- Women Ratio = \frac{P(0-4)}{f(15-44)}K$$
Where;
K= 1000
###### Assumptions
###### Significance
- measures incidence of child bearing in the population of adult women
###### Limitations
- 
##### 2. Crude Birth Rate (CBR)

$$ CBR = \frac {B}{P}*K$$
Where;
B= Total birth registered in the year
P= Total mid-year population
K=1000
###### Assumptions
###### Significance
- It directly points to the contribution of fertility to the growth rate of Population
- It requires minimum of data for computation
- 
###### Limitations
- Counts ineligible population Male and children
- Does not take into consideration age
- CBR does not define why birth rates are different in different years and between different population
##### 3. General Fertility Rate (GFR)
$$ GFR = \frac {B}{P(15-49)}*K$$
Where;
*B = Total registered live birth
P(15-49) = Mid-year population of the women age group (15-49)
K = 1000*
###### Assumptions
###### Significance
###### Limitations
##### 4. Age specific Fertility Rate(ASFR)
$$ ASFR = \frac {bi}{Pi}*k $$
Where;
*bi= Number of birth registered during the year to women in the interval*
*Pi = Indicates the mid-year population of women in the same age-group*
###### Assumptions

###### Significance

###### Limitations
##### 5. Total Fertility Rate (TFR)
$$ TFR = \sum \frac {bi}{pi}K$$
Where;
*i = 15,16,17 ... 49
bi = Number of live births registered during the year to mother of age(i)
pi = Mid-year population of the women of the same age
K= 1000*
###### Assumptions
###### Significance
- It is cumulative age-specific fertility
###### Limitations
- Requires age specific data to calculate
##### 6. Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR)
It is restricted to female birth only.
It is usually 1/2 of the total fertility rate
###### Assumptions
- All girl child born will become future mother
##### 7. Standard Fertility Rate
Other characteristics of the population; demographic, social or economic are taken into consideration to make it rate comparable.
##### 8. Cohort Fertility
