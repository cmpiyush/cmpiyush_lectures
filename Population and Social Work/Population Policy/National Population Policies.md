#### POPULATION POLICY: NEED AND ITS  IMPORTANCE
Population growth is a vital demographic problem at least in developing countries. Therefore many developing countries have formulated population policies for controlling fertility and growth of population. Population policy refers to **a plan of action or course of action which the national and provincial government purse to achieve desired objectives.** A few objectives of the population policy may be as follows: 
(I)  **Control the unwanted fertility** among the population by the use various population control methods such as family planning methods. 
(II) **To aim at small family norm for raising the quality of life of the population**. 
(III) **Use of various communication media for propagation of information regarding population control measures.** 
(IV) **To strengthen the health care status of the women, children, and elderly population.** 
(V) To assess the **mortality and morbidity** status of the population and **take corrective measures**.  
#### NATIONAL POPUALTION POLICY - 1976 
The salient features of 1976 population policy were as follows:  
1. To enhance the age of marriage for girls to 18 years (from 15 years since 1949 prior to this it was 14 years since 1929) and for boys to 21 years (from 18 years since 1949).
2. To take appropriate measures for raising the level of female education in all States.
3. Giving monetary incentive to persons undergoing sterilization according to the number of children in the family. 
4. Additional incentives to be given to the government employees undergoing sterilization, having up to two children. 
5. Inculcating population education through the formal education system.
6. Control of population becomes a factor for sharing of central resources with that of the states. 8% of the central assistance was linked to the State Plans by weighing the performance of the states in the family welfare programmes. 

In 1977, after the emergency some modification was done in the population policy of 1976 more particularly **to address the coercive method of population control**. The features of the policy were as follows: 
(a) The name of the **family planning programme was changed to family welfare programme**.  
(b)  The marriage age for girls was fixed at 18 years and for boys at 21 years. This has been implemented by the **Child Marriage Restraint (Amendment) Act, 1978**.  
(c)  **The sterilization method of family planning made voluntary.**  
(d)  Population education was integrated into the formal education system.  
(e)  Monetary incentive was given to those who went for sterilization and tubectomy.  
(f)  Private companies to be exempted from corporate taxes those popularize birth control measures among their employees.  
(g)  Historical Perspective of Population Policies in India Use of media for spreading family planning in rural areas. 
(h)  The policy put an end to compulsory sterilization and laid emphasis on voluntary sterilization. 
#### Criticism against the Population Policy
(i) At the outset it was criticized on the ground that it has had **a narrow perspective**. It has given much **emphasis on contraception and sterilization.** 
(ii) As the basic prerequisites of controlling population are poverty alleviation, and to improve the standards of living. The policy seems to have not taken these two aspects while formulating its strategies. 
(iii) The policy was not given adequate coverage in the media and therefore failed to generate mass support in favour of population control. 
(iv) There was insufficient infrastructure and lack of lack of trained staff, lack of adequate aptitude among the staff and limited use or misuse of the equipment for population control resulted in failure of the policy. 
(v) Lastly, the use of coercion during the Emergency (1976-77) caused a serious resentment among the masses. This made the NPP very unpopular. 
#### National Population Policy, 2000 
Indiaâ€™s population reached 100 crore on May 11, 2000 and it is estimated that if current trends of population increase continue she will become the most populous country in the world by 2045 when it would overtake China. There was need for the formulation of a population policy. Some of the milestones which were critical to the formulation of the population policy are as follows: 
(i) 1946 Bhore Committee Report 
(ii) 1952 Launching of Family Planning Programme 
(iii) 1976 Statement of National Population Policy  
(iv) 1977 Policy Statement on Family Welfare Programme Both statements were laid on the Table of the House in Parliament, but never discussed or adopted.  
(v)  1983 The National Health Policy of 1983 emphasized the need for "securing the small family norm, through voluntary efforts and moving towards the goal of population stabilization". Therefore it was emphasized the need for a separate National Population Policy.  
(vi) 1991 The National Development Council appointed a Committee on Population with Shri Karunakaran as Chairman. The Karunakaran Report (Report of the National Development Council (NDC) Committee on Population) endorsed by NDC in 1993 proposed the formulation of a National Population Policy to take a " a long term holistic view of development, population growth and environmental protection" and to "suggest policies and guidelines (for) formulation of programs" and "a monitoring mechanism with short, medium and long term perspectives and goals" (Planning Commission, 1992). 
(vii) 1993 An Expert Group headed by Dr. M.S. Swaminathan was asked to prepare a draft of a national population policy. 
##### The three types of objectives formulated in the Population policy 2000 are as follows: 
**I. Objectives**
	**(i) The Immediate Objective:**
	- Address the unmet needs for contraception,  
	- Provide health care infrastructure and health personnel and to provide integrated service delivery for basic reproductive and child health care. 
	**(ii) The Medium term Objective:**  
	The medium term objective is to bring the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) to replacement level by 2010 through vigorous implementation in inter-sectorial operational strategies. 
	**(iii)  The Long term Objective:**  
	The long term objective is to achieve a stable population by 2045 at a level consistent with the requirements of sustainable economic growth, social development, and environment protection. 
**II. Targets of NPP 2000:** 
The targets set by the NPP 2000 are as follows:

14. Promote vigorously the small family norm to achieve replacement levels of TFR. 
15. Bring about convergence in implementation of related social sector programs so that family welfare becomes a people centred programme. 
#### Critique of National Population Policy 2000
-  Population is not integrated with health, it has population stabilisation rather than the health and wellbeing of the population as a goal, and so on.
-  It is thus surprising that several state governments have announced population policies, which, in very significant manners, violate the letter and the spirit of the National Population Policy.
- The Uttar Pradesh policy, for instance, disqualifies persons married before the legal age of marriage from government jobs, as if children are responsible for child marriages.
#### IV. National Commission on Population: 
In pursuance of NPP, 2000, the Government of India set up a National Commission on Population (NCP) on 11 May 2000.
