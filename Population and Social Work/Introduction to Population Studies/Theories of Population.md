#### Pre-Malthusian 
##### Mercantilist
It is an Economic philosophy. According to Mercantilist a nation's wealth consists of precious metals namely gold and silver. If a country did not possess gold or silver mines, it could earn such wealth only by achieving a favourable balance of trade. This can only be achieved by exporting more goods than importing them and thereby adding more gold and silver to its national coffers. Such balance of trade required the production of goods for export. This meant that the importance of industry rather than that of agriculture had to be emphasised. In such a situation, the demand for workers was bound to increase and, therefore, a sized population was considered to be an essential factor in the economic and political power of a country. Here, again, the number of workers rather than their quality or skill was the main consideration. Sometimes this principle was stretched to such an extent that, in France, even children above the age of six were recruited. The general opinion related to population at that particular period of time was that birth rates should be increased for various economic and political gains. 
To achieve this objective the following measures were adopted:  
(i) Placing various disabilities on celibates;  
(ii) Encouraging marriages directly;  
(iii) Encouraging fertility;  
(iv) Making punishment for illegitimate births less severe or abolishing such punishment entirely; and  
(v) Encouraging immigration and preventing emigration. 

Among the early mercantile writers, the most important were Niccolò Machiavelli (1469-1527) and Giovanni Botero (1540-1617). 
**Machiavelli** (1469-1527), was perhaps the first to view population from the modern perspective, by observing that excessive population would diminish through want and disease. In other words he saw the relationship between population growth and resources. He may be considered as one of the precursors of Malthus.  
**Giovanni Botero** (1540-1617), an Italian citizen, was also one of the first to study population phenomena in a broad scientific manner. Along with Machiavelli, he may be considered one of the precursors of Malthus, as his work contained the basic thoughts of the Malthusian doctrines. He expounded that a population, after increasing for some time, cannot continue to increase at the same rate. It may grow slowly or may even start declining. In his opinion, the limitation of the means of subsistence was the reason why population growth had to be limited. He regarded limited means of subsistence as the primary check to population growth, while the secondary checks were sterility of the soil, bad climate, disease and epidemics. Botero was convinced that food for subsistence was necessary for any population. He was also of the opinion that a large population act as a source of strength for a country.

#### Physiocratic
It is an economic school evolved in France about the middle of the eighteenth century. It was considered as the expression of a reaction against the mercantilist ideas and politics. While the mercantilists had neglected agriculture in their enthusiasm for the acquisition of gold and silver through trade in manufactured goods, the basic assumption of the physiocratic school was **that land was the source of all wealth and hence it was necessary to emphasise the importance of agriculture and internal tax reforms**. As a reaction against the large population centric tenets of the mercantilists, the physiocrats did not favour population increase at the cost of standards of living. They approved of such increase only if it was possible to expand agricultural production.

Quesney (1694-1774) was the founder of the physiocratic school. Like mercantile writers, Quesney was also supported the idea of a large population for a country. However, he was of the opinion that **a large population was desirable only if it could be made comfortable**. 

**Mirabeau (1715-1789)**, another French economic thinker, was of the opinion that **a larger population would be desirable for the state, but agriculture must be encouraged because this population would have to be fed.** 

Similar views were expressed by **Mercier de la Riviere(1719-1801)**, (Full name: Pierre Paul François Joachim Henri Le Mercier de La Rivière de Saint-Médard) though he maintained that **in a well-administered state, population would not increase faster than the means of subsistence.**

**Richard Cantillon** **(1680s-1734)**, was an Irish economist and financier who wrote one of the earliest treatises on modern economics. He looked upon as a mercantilist in many respects, also shared some of the opinions of the physiocrats. He believed that **the size of agricultural production of wealth, would determine the size of the population.**

These work were mostly focused on economic aspect of a nation and population were just considered as a part of the process. However, **Thomas Robert Malthus (1766-1834)**, an English economist, gave serious thoughts on the state of population and resources.

#### Malthusian Theory of Population
Robert Malthus was an English economist and demographer who is best known for his theory that population growth will always tend to outrun the food supply and that betterment of humankind is impossible without stern limits on reproduction. This thinking is commonly referred to as Malthusianism.

From the mid-18th century, writings began to highlight that population grows faster than food supply, paving the way for Malthusian Theory.
- The shift from an optimistic view, of Mercantile and Physiocrats, which saw a growing population as a strength, to a pessimistic view that considered large populations undesirable in relation to subsistence.
- Concerns emerged regarding human reproductive power, limited land, and means of subsistence leading to over-population issues.
- The belief in the necessity of checks on population growth became prevalent, countering the idea of prolific fertility as a patriotic duty.
- Intellectuals focused on responsible parenthood and checks on child-bearing due to the excess fertility of the poor and the societal burden from Poor Laws.

He published his most notable work *"An Essay on the Principle of Population as It Affects the Future Improvement of Society, with Remarks on the Speculations of Mr. Godwin, M. Condorcet, and Other Writers"* (1798, 1806, 1826).

 In each edition, he updated the book to incorporate criticism as well as to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject.  Malthus proposed two hypotheses. These hypotheses were as follows:  
 (i) Food is necessary to the existence of human being; and 
 (ii) The passion between the sexes is necessary and will remain nearly in its present state.  
 
 Based on these two hypotheses he asserted that: 
 (i) The power of population is indefinitely greater than the power in the earth to produce subsistence for human being. Population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio whereas subsistence i.e. production of food substances increases only in an arithmetical ratio.  
 
 (ii) In all societies, even those that are most vicious, the tendency to a virtuous attachment is so strong that there is a constant effort towards an increase of population. This constant effort constantly tends to subject the lower classes of the society to distress and to prevent any great permanent amelioration of their condition.

Malthus identified two types of checks on population growth: positive and preventative.
- Positive checks increase the death rate, including hunger, disease, and war.
- Preventative checks decrease the birth rate, encompassing abortion, postponement of marriage, and celibacy.
- In later editions, Malthus emphasized the importance of moral restraint, encouraging postponement of marriage until individuals could financially support a family.
- He argued that widespread moral restraint was the best way to alleviate poverty among lower classes, aligning with virtue, economic benefits, and social progress.
#### Criticism of Malthusian Theory of Population
Criticism: Some of the major criticisms of Malthus Theory are as follows: 
1. Malthus basic premise on passion between sexes has been questioned on the plea that the desire to have children cannot be mixed with passion and desire for sex. The desire for sex is a biological instinct where as the desire to have children is a social instinct. 
2. The validity of two ratios proposed by Malthus was also questioned on the basis of empirical evidence that population has rarely grown by geometric progression and similarly production of food rarely multiplied in arithmetic progression. 
3. The time span of 25 years assumed by Malthus for doubling of population is also not seem to be anywhere near reality because it varies from country to country depending upon demographic situation of that particular country. For example, it took Mexico only 20 years to double the population whereas USA which is the adjoining country took 120 years for the same. 
4. Malthus also seems to be swayed by the supremacy of positive checks like delayed marriage, moral restraints and controlled frequency of sex after marriage. It is rather strange that Malthus could not think of the use of contraceptives as an effective preventive check despite the fact that Malthus very much knew about it.   
5. Malthus was severely criticized for ignoring the role of changing technology and changes in socio-economic set up of a society. 
#### Neo-Malthus
 Neo-Malthusian are those who beliefs Malthus. In other words the neoMalthusians may be categorized as a group of thinkers and academicians who were essentially agreed with Malthusian proposition but disagreed with his idea on controlling measures. If we trace the evolution of the term or “neo-Malthusianism” this was first used in 1877 by Dr. Samuel Van Houten, one of the vice- presidents of the Malthusian League. 

Neo-Malthusian agreed that control of population is inevitable and have pessimistic views that consider the growth of world population with fear and alarm. However, they disagree with Malthus that factors like war and famine are the key to population control and reject such simplistic notions. Instead they promote a number of ideals for example planned parenthood as a method of population control.

#### Marx
He merely defined the population principle peculiar to capitalist society characterised by large-scale replacement of labour by machinery. He called this the ‘**law of relative surplus population**’. Marx’s explanation implied that are relative surplus of population associated with the capitalist mode of production would disappear when capitalism is replaced by some kind of a collective mode of production. Marx believed that the surplus product of labour, previously appropriated by the capitalists, would be returned to its natural owners – the workers, thereby eliminating poverty. With rise in income and improvement in standards of living, the death rate would decline. The birth rate would also, in the long run, begin declining with the rise in living standards and the end of the exploitation of children. 
Marx argued that what Malthus saw the problem related to the pressure of population on the means of production actually represented the pressure of the means of production on population. Thus he viewed it in terms of their concept of the **reserve army of labour**. Reserve army of labour is a concept in Karl Marx's critique of political economy. It refers to the unemployed in capitalist society. The use of the word "army" refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a hierarchy, under the command or authority of the owners of capital. 

#### Ester Boserup (1910 – 1999)

- Ester Boserup, a Danish economist, focused on economic and agricultural development and developed the theory of agricultural intensification.
- She argued that population growth is a primary driver of agricultural change, leading to increased land use intensity through more frequent cropping.
- Boserup claimed that agricultural intensification would not happen without population growth, which could reduce labor productivity.
- Her theory suggested that this intensification results in technological advancements and changes in agricultural practices and land tenure systems.
- Unlike Malthusian views, Boserup's theory posits that population growth leads to technological innovation rather than being limited by it.
