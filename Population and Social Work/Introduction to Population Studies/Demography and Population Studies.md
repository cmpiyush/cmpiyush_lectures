#### Unit -1: Demography and population- Meaning; Sources of demographic data: Census, Vital registration, National Sample Survey, Sample Registration Scheme.
##### Demography
Demography word comes from the Greek word 'Demos' (δῆμος) meaning people or population and 'graphy' (γραφία) means meaning "description" or "writing about".
Thus, demographic analysis focuses on the study of the components of the population variation and change. Studies quantitative relationship among demographic phenomena.
##### Population Studies
Population studies, often used as a synonyms of demography, is a broad study of population in the field of social science. It covers the interdisciplinary relationship of the population with social, economic, political, biological, genetics, geographical and the like.

Warren S. Thompson: Population studies should concern with:
1. changes in the size of the population
2. how these changes are brought about and,
3. What is the significance of change from human welfare/social welfare standpoint.

So, demography is concerned with its size or numbers, its structure and characteristics, its distribution and the changes taking place in it over a period of time.
- Demographic variables: Birth/Fertility, Death/Mortality and Migration/Immigration
- Population structure: age and sex structure of the population
- Population Characteristics: Marital Status, Literacy and education status, labour force status etc.
- Characteristic of population changes with social mobility such as marriage, changes in occupation etc. and through demographic variables as well.

Whereas Population studies is concerned with social, economic, political and other influences on population and vice-versa.

However, it is difficult to define a clear boundaries between Demography and Population Studies. Demographic analysis would not have any meaning if not framed from the inter-disciplinary field. Similarly, without demographic data and analysis population studies could not reliable.
- Population Structure implies composition or distribution of the population according to age and sex only.
- Population Characteristics: Composition of population by religion, caste, ethnicity, occupation, education etc.
- Population characteristics changes through mobility in the population.
- Population Process: Mortality, Fertility and Migration
***
- John Graunt is generally acclaimed as the father of Demography or population studies. "Nature and Political Observation Made upon the Bills of Mortality" (1662) is landmark in the history of Population studies.
- Sir William Petty (1623-1687), population studies as "Political Arithmetic".
- Prepared life table with John Graunt.
- Edmund Halley (1665-1742), his contribution was so influential that a comet named after him.
- He prepared first empirical life table and coined the term "Expectation of life".
- Gregory King (1648-1712) estimated Population of England and Wales.
- Germany, Netherland, Sweden and other European countries took interest in population studies.
##### Population Studies in Indian context
###### Before colonisation
- Kautilya's Arthshatra during Chandragupta Maurya (323-300BC): How to conduct a population, economic and agriculture census.
- Abul Fazal's *Ain-i-Akabari* during Akbar (1556-1605): contains comprehensive data on population industry, wealth and characteristics.
###### Census in British India
- Regular after first decennial census conducted in 1872.
- Kingsley Davis wrote a book based on the census 1872 to 1941 *The Population of India and Pakistan* a strong foundation of population study.
- The Imperial Gazetteers published since 1881(9 volumes): Important contribution in establishing Population studies in India.
- Indian contribution: P.K. Wattle wrote about population problem in 1916. His work did not get much traction but his later work *Population Problem in India* based on census result 1931 brought interest of the people in Population studies.
- Dr. Radhakamal Mukherjee Food Planning for 400 million population 1941.
- Professor P.C Mahalanobis and Indian Statistical Institute. In 1937, institute started collecting fetility data.
###### Post-Independence 
- NSSO
- "Mysore Population study" first population study for socio-culture factor affecting fertility.
#### Basic Demographic Concepts
Demographic Transition Model by C. P. Blacker's five stage of Population growth.
***Stage 1: High stationary stage*** 

| Birth Rate is High                   | Death Rate is High                 |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Lack of Family Planning<br>          | High prevalence of Disease         |
| High infant motality rate            | Famine                             |
| Need for large workers               | Lack of Clean Water and Sanitation |
| Religious belief                     | Lack of Health Care                |
| Family member as <br>Economic assets | War                                |
|                                      | Natural Calamities                 |
|                                      | Lack of life saving education      |

***Stage 2: Early Expanding

| Birth Rate | Death Rate fallen                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
|            | Improved health Care              |
|            | Improved hygiene                  |
|            | Improved Sanitation               |
|            | Improved food production          |
|            | Improved transport for food       |
|            | Decreased infant mortality rates  |
***Stage 3: Late Expanding
