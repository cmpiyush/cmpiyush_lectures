#### Basic Concepts
***Death:*** "Death is the permanent disappearance of all evidence of life at any time after birth has taken place(post-natal cessation of vital functions without capacity of resuscitation)" (UN and WHO)
***Foetal Deaths:*** "death prior to the complete expulsion or extraction from its mother as a product of conception, irrespective of the duration of pregnancy; the death is indicates by the fact that after such separation, the foetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life, such as beating of the heart, pulsation or the umbilical cord or definite movement of voluntary muscles"
Early Foetal Mortality
Intermediate Foetal Mortality
Late Foetal Mortality
Infant Mortality
Neo-natal Period
Neo-natal Mortality
Early Neo-natal Mortality
Late Neo-natal Mortality
Post-neo-natal Mortality
Perinatal Mortality
Maternal Mortality
#### Why Mortality?
- *Helps to understand widowhood, orphan and also social, economic and political life
- _how far a society is healthy and direction in which it is moving_
- _Life saving facility
- _Projection of the population_
- _Comparison of the progress_
- Classifying the cause of disease
- More death can lead to change the attitude of loved ones towards life.
- High mortality can reduce the ambition of the parents towards their children.
- May lead to rise of superstitious belief
#### Primary Source of Data
- Death registration
- Hospital
- Cremation Record 
#### Limitation of Mortality Data
- Unreliable when large scale mortality happens due to war or epidemic.
- False reporting of cause of death/time of death
- Unrecorded deaths
- Different definition of mortality particularly a child:- In Mexico and Cuba child died within 24hrs are considered as abortion
#### Mortality Rate
##### 1. Crude Death Rate
$$ CDR = \frac {D}{P} $$
Where;
_D= Deaths registered in a year
P= Population of an area in that year $$ P = P_{1} +{1/2}{(P_{2}}-{P_{1})}$$
K= 100000_
###### Advantage
- It becomes possible to reduce the death rate into one figure only
- It is very easy and can be understood by common man
###### Disadvantage
- Extreme cases are adversely affect the rate
- Difficult to get reliable mortality data
#### 2. Age Specific Death Rate
$$ ASDR = \frac {No.\ of\ death\ in\ a\ specific\ age\ or\ age\ group}{Total\ Polation\ in\ that\ age\ group }
$$
#### 3. Standardised or Adjusted Death Rate
##### Direct Standardisation
$$ Standarised\ Death\ Rate = \frac {P_{s}*D_{1}}{\sum P}
$$
Where,
P$_s$ = Standard Population of the age group.
D$_1$ = Age specific death rate of the population in age group.

#### 4. Infant Death Rate
Infant Mortality Rate measures the risk of dying during the first year of life. Probability of a dying for an infant within a year of its birth.
$$ IMR =\frac {D_{0}}{B}X1000$$


#### 5. Cause specific Death Rate
Similar to age specific death rate. Instead of age death are counted cause of death.
