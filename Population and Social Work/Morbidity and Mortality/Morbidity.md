### Basic Concepts
#### Health:
Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. (WHO)

Health states consist of three major domains of interest:
a) Morbidity: State of being illness, disease
b) Disability: Restricting or lack of ability
c) Mortality: Loss of life
#### Disease
" a state, which limits life in its power, duration or happiness". A departure from a state of health.
#### Illness
"a subjective state of a person who feels aware pf not being well"
#### Sickness
"a role that individual assumes when ill"
#### Impairment
"any loss or abnormality of psychological physiological or anatomical structure or function."
#### Disability 

### Morbidity
"The study of morbidity deals with the investigation of illness, sickness ill-health or disease in a population. Two aspects are considered: the incidence of disease and the prevalence of disease..."

J.B. Stillman (1988) puts it "Morbidity is the extend of illness (disease), injury, or disability in a defined population".

Disability Free Life Expectancy (DFLE) or Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALY)

Morbidity are of two fundamental types, **Self-perceived** and **Observed** 

##### Need for and Importance of Morbidity Statistics
We do have complete knowledge of disease and morbidity statistics. 
1. how many people suffer from a particular disease?
2. how often they suffer?
3. For how long they suffer?
4. What types of demands these diseases make on the medical and public resources?
5. What financial loss they cause?
6. How fatal the different diseases are?
7. To what extent are people limited by these disease from carrying out their normal activities?
8. To what extent are the disease concentrated in specific group of the population, e.g. according to age, sex, marital status, ethnic group, occupation or place of residence, etc.
9. How far do the above factors vary over time? (Seasonal variation)
10. What is the effect of medical care and health services on the control of disease incidence?
##### Sources of Morbidity Statistics
1. Notifiable disease records.
2. Hospital records
3. PHCC, Clinics, 
4. School Medical Service
5. Factory medical staff
6. Special sickness survey
7. Life and sickness insurance
8. Community Medical Care Programme
9. National/Local registers on cancer, tuberculosis
10. Statistics of cause of death
11. Industrial sickness benefit association
12. Recruitment of the armed forces or gaol directories
13. Screening survey and sero-surveillance of disease
14. sickness record from education and other institutions.
#### Measure of Morbidity

**Incidence: relates to the emerging new cases (a 'flow' concept)**
**Prevalence: is numbers existing at a point of time (a 'stock' concept)**

Classification of morbidity condition
1. Illness beginning and ending during the period
2. Illness beginning and continuing at the end of the period
3. Illness existing before the period and ending during the period
4. Illness existing before the period and continuing at the end of the period.

**Incident Rate**

$$ Crude\ Incident\ Rate = \frac {I}{P}*1000 $$
Where;
I = Illness or Injury annual basis
P= Population living in the community during reference period

**Example:** The mid-year resident population of Patna in 2024 was 1,04,70,050 and the total number of new cased of malaria detected by different hospitals was 77,690. What is the CIR of Malaria in Patna in 2024.

$$ CIR = \frac {77690}{10470050}*1000 $$
$$ = 7.4$$
Thus, CIR of malaria is 7.4 incidence per 1000 population.

**Attack Rate**: When a population is exposed to the risk of disease for a limited period of time, the incidence rate may be termed as the 'attack rate'
$$ **Secondary Attack Rate** = \frac {the\ number\ of\ illness\ with\ the\ same\ disease\ of\ the\ index\ person}{Number\ of\ person\ exposed\ excluding\ the\ index\ person}*100 $$
**Prevalence Rate**
	**Period Prevalence Rate:** measure the frequency of illness in existence during a defined period (a day, a month, a year etc.) CPR- Crude period prevalence 
	**Point Prevalence Rate**: measure the number of cases of illness, new and old, existing at a particular point of time, such as 10:00 AM on Monday, the 25th October 1999. and related to the number of persons exposed to the risk at that point of time. Numerator include all cases irrespective of the length of time.
It is determined for chronic illness such as Leprosy, tuberculosis, filariasis, cancer, diabetes, hyper tension, HIV/AIDS etc.
