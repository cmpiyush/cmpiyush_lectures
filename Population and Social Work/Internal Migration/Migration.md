- It is important to compare with non-migrant group
**Age**: In most study the age group of 15-35 migrates more frequently.
**Sex**: Male migrates were urbanisation is still low, while female takes well-established and secure migratory move
**Marital Status**: Research has yet to find the pattern, in USA single have less migrates while married people have migrated more. While in Asia and Africa married male migrates and send remittances to the family back home.
**Fertility**: Yet to identify the pattern, however in USA it is found that migrants have less fertility than native.
**Education**: In-migrants are less educated than the non-migrants at the place of destination.
#### Migration patterns in countries

#### Determinants and Consequences of Internal Migration
- Low agriculture income
- Agriculture employment
- Under-employment
- High man to land ratio- cause of poverty and out migration
- low rate of investment in agriculture
- fragmentation of landownership

- In low income countries like India, Spatial symptoms of underdevelopment mostly caused by mercantile capitalism. It happened in costal regions.
#### Spatial Disorganisation and Internal Migration
- From UP and Bihar to costal foreign enclaves still exists
- Sometime 50% population have history of migration
#### Consequences of Internal Migration
##### On Rural Areas
- Effect on rural incomes and its distribution: Remittances increases the income in the rural areas, however it could also reduces the income because usually young(15-35) migrates.
- Effect on rural capital formation and technological change: Lack of labour demands labour saving technology
- Effect on modes of rural production: Hire labour
- Effects on rural fertility: 
	- Income is a determinants of fertility, 
	- migration of unmarried may imbalance the sex ratio
	- Changes in family structure
	- Migration at fertility age by male may lower the fertility
	- Person may delay his marriage so that he can migrate and help family
