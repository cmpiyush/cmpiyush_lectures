#### Why Mortality?
- *Helps to understand widowhood, orphan and also social, economic and political life
- _how far a society is healthy and direction in which it is moving_
- _Life saving facility
- _Projection of the population_
- _Comparison of the progress_
- Classifying the cause of disease
- More death can lead to change the attitude of loved ones towards life.
- High mortality can reduce the ambition of the parents towards their children.
- May lead to rise of superstitious belief
#### Primary Source of Data
- Death registration
- Hospital
- Cremation Record 
#### Limitation of Mortality Data
- Unreliable when large scale mortality happens due to war or epidemic.
- False reporting of cause of death/time of death
- Unrecorded deaths
- Different definition of mortality particularly a child:- In Mexico and Cuba child died within 24hrs are considered as abortion
#### Mortality Rate
##### 1. Crude Death Rate
$$ CDR = \frac {D}{P} $$
Where;
_D= Deaths registered in a year
P= Population of an area in that year $$ P = P_{1} +{1/2}{(P_{2}}-{P_{1})}$$
K= 100000_
###### Advantage
- It becomes possible to reduce the death rate into one figure only
- It is very easy and can be understood by common man
###### Disadvantage
- Extreme cases are adversely affect the rate
- Difficult to get reliable mortality data
#### 2. Age Specific Death Rate
$$ ASDR = \frac {No.\ of\ death\ in\ a\ specific\ age\ or\ age\ group}{Total\ Polation\ in\ that\ age\ group }
$$
#### 3. Standardised or Adjusted Death Rate
##### Direct Standardisation
$$ Standarised\ Death\ Rate = \frac {P_{s}*D_{1}}{\sum P}
$$
Where,
P$_s$ = Standard Population of the age group.
D$_1$ = Age specific death rate of the population in age group.

#### 4. Infant Death Rate
Infant Mortality Rate measures the risk of dying during the first year of life. Probability of a dying for an infant within a year of its birth.
$$ IMR =\frac {D_{0}}{B}X1000$$


#### 5. Cause specific Death Rate
Similar to age specific death rate. Instead of age death are counted cause of death.

## Explanation of Columns

- **xxx** = starting age of interval
- *l$_x$ = number of people alive at start (radix usually 100,000 at birth)
- **dxd_xdx​** = number dying in the age interval
- **qxq_xqx​** = probability of dying between ages xxx and x+nx+nx+n
- **pxp_xpx​** = probability of surviving the interval (px=1−qxp_x = 1 - q_xpx​=1−qx​)
- **LxL_xLx​** = total person-years lived in interval (approximation: midpoint of deaths)
- **TxT_xTx​** = cumulative total years lived by the cohort beyond age xxx
- **exe_xex​** = life expectancy at age xxx (Tx/lxT_x / l_xTx​/lx​)
##### Assumptions
- There is no migration
