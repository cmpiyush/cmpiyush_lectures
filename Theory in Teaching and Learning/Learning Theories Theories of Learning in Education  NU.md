## What Are the 5 Major Learning Theories?

A variety of learning theories have arisen within, and impacted the course of, the field of education. But these theories aren’t just abstract ideas, or academic concepts — on the contrary, they’re practical approaches to education that teachers can put into use in order to help students learn more effectively at every age.

That’s an important topic that we’ll discuss more later on in this guide, where we’ll share a few tips and strategies for utilizing theories of learning in the classroom. For now, let’s look at some key differences between five of the most prominent learning theories: Behaviourism, Cognitivism, Connectivism, Constructivism, and Humanism.

##### Behaviourism

Founded by John B. Watson (but widely associated with Ivan Pavlov and B.F. Skinner), Behaviorism is the idea that — like Bandura’s Social Learning Theory — children learn by observing the behavior of others, whether adults and authority figures or friends and peers their own age. In Behaviorism, the learner’s mind is a “blank slate” ready to absorb knowledge — and repetition and reinforcement play a key role in communicating with students.

For instance, the teacher will use either negative or positive reinforcement, which respectively means subtracting (“negative”) or adding (“positive”) something, in order to reinforce the desired behavior (or discourage an undesired behavior). An example of positive reinforcement might be rewarding or praising a behavior like volunteering during group discussions.

##### Cognitivism

Introduced during the middle of the 20th century, Cognitivism shifts away from Behaviorism to place a heavier emphasis on the internal thoughts of the observer, as opposed to merely observing others’ behavior and responding to stimuli. In contrast to Behaviorism, Cognitivism holds that learning chiefly takes place while the student is working to break down and organize new information in their mind.

Journaling is frequently suggested as a helpful classroom exercise that uses the principles of Cognitivism. We’ll explore some additional ways of applying Cognitivism and other learning theories at the end of this guide.

##### Constructivism

According to Constructivist Learning Theory, or CLT, students learn new information by building upon — or in other words, constructing — knowledge they’ve already gained. This represents a [more active approach](https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html) to learning, as opposed to an approach like Behaviorism, where students arguably [take a more passive role](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/277811/1-s2.0-S1877042810X00143/1-s2.0-S1877042810023426/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEDIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIHaFOTA3rGFzw%2BmdBWPbAr8U3XwgX8J6KcDo0A%2FNGkg5AiEApdkr8sVQs0dn0VYAyTILTKomljXJnqClSpWWTGMyzgoq1QQI2%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARAFGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDL7xhilsQGYuIVDbyCqpBC7Ql7c2WE3Hp9E8vIo70tYbIm4yUPmQfE7KgBHgh9dFTH%2FBKRzKU1FjDEc0lczy7go8kz15VdwiRJUf39DSC66ycF1svkgp1kiGx2AMkql2yRTm9d8JQ5nX5hb5I%2B0PG4jxz2Yb7SK0ALlRCYP9EAQVav274VqzGIBFfyFpVn%2BFX%2FU9cRQh0yOKdbfLcDssj82%2Bo25hbQNkGFps1X9mnyr7X%2FP0huC3mzbieK2Ma88pumRZcpEW4k%2B2ivL4%2FYPLQdLGdXx0S51szMOq66lk%2F1t2UrhmlvQuQbLNsc5WjrpKjdp5Kojj7KcaOzgM8le9mDD9fM28s%2BE6saufxo5K%2B%2BbbWqayov8GNF%2B4ZOpsUxx%2Fq1%2BlLI%2Bs4g5NOyZjdNLyIY2lP6GZag8ZO34mPmuTc8FFCI%2BHW1P1WGZHJ5qX6HsekmUuIN8r6wL9P4OieME6acJgwsYch8u70bz0k3yQh2BUJ1wmEKbmHFPbGCBDOpAHuRjB9xpC38STreNBcMXRhLzlKxTrd%2BYHfS8bbjTN4W3FaDTqI41F7XqTzn%2FB3iFqwHpfZ3B524Z2G2oncM5%2Fu9GxeCRmaJtSKxACJSLWjQB9sfn1%2FDqFq6gY66fTfBTd90UGUP5T3nDclRKj8vlThZuup9EX%2BJlIkWTh%2FytxXmGZYYoZM8PnKZ61LbT0bUHvfKaf%2B7I7Rjn2KyaCYlD9eSH1vQqKOnc5EBi6T7nKbXjjspxak4TBT8kwkaDCmQY6qQGwXnqudMdYUzGmP9ejVqszydFOb1eHag6rMzYgYHHrECZem4x3a15QiaK1BtEaQKImWYDw0w%2BvahDYy78h0XFlde16e8x8frR8zBpnrAdcyaAGzRd8tQl%2Bi91B5%2B3WhMlrMbZmjZR%2B1%2B0UnIvlnGFtSU9nLeowOYxMF1isy0fPCfNeKkolynItClJyCYa%2BHbKCcIRfKjicYE4JwgNC8tch4kjSPiYJdZ5H&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20220925T183600Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=299&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTYR3G42QUG%2F20220925%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=362572cfb22fcf7167d1db5e5cda03ed4abae23b6b871906aa25565c7484b411&hash=d6c4cc1098d46b4b25bf9c3349d13db8ad8f29a7518c9b30fb0ae50cb8f589e4&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S1877042810023426&tid=spdf-fd5a1344-e94b-4ec8-9a3e-ea559d9ebf34&sid=5b3757e58895f447c2985b29eef3cd265ff1gxrqa&type=client&ua=4d5351560a0400540359&rr=7505dce7e90dc359) in learning.

Cognitive Constructivism is associated with Jean Piaget, while Social Constructivism is linked to pioneer Lev Vygotsky. Read more about the differences between [Social and Cognitive Constructivist Theory](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ871658).

##### Humanism

Founded by pioneers like Carl Rogers, James F. T. Bugental, and Abraham Maslow (whose famous “Hierarchy of Needs” you’re likely already familiar with), Humanist Learning Theory (HLT) is a learner-centric approach to education. Humanist Learning Theory places a heavier emphasis on the learner themselves — and their untapped potential — rather than the methods of learning or the materials being taught. Built on the premise that humans are fundamentally good and will act appropriately if their basic needs are met, HLT prioritizes meeting the unique emotional and academic needs of each learner so that they are empowered to take greater control over their own education.

##### Connectivism

Connectivism, as we mentioned above, has been called a learning theory for the 21st century. But, other than its relatively recent introduction as a theory of learning, what makes Connectivism so useful and relevant to the modern student — and educator?

Critically, Connectivist Learning Theory makes effective use of technology, which is an essential tool for learning — particularly among Generation Z students and future generations. Connectivism also places a strong emphasis on the ability to find and sift through information in order to conduct reliable research. Some examples of a Connectivist approach to teaching might be to have your students write a blog or launch a podcast together — activities that merge technology with group and community interaction.

##### Other theories
### Transformative Learning Theory
This theory, often associated with Jack Mezirow, focuses on how adults learn by reassessing their assumptions and perspectives. It’s particularly beneficial for adult learning as it emphasizes critical reflection and the possibility of changing one’s viewpoints through new information and experiences.
### Social Learning Theory
Developed by Albert Bandura, social learning theory emphasizes that people learn by observing others. It highlights the importance of modelling behaviour, collaboration, and social interactions, making it especially useful in group learning scenarios.
#### Experiential Learning Theory
Experiential learning, championed by David Kolb, suggests that learning occurs through experience, followed by reflection. This hands-on approach is perfect for students who thrive in practical settings such as internships, simulations, or laboratory work.
