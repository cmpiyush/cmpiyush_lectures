Sukhadeo Thorat's central argument is that **inherited caste identity serves as a significant determinant of life opportunity for a fifth of the world's population, particularly in India, and is a continuing structural cause of inequality and poverty**. He contends that this issue is often neglected in global development policy debates, unlike other identity characteristics such as gender or race, and argues for its proper recognition and policy innovation.(Thorat et al., 2010)

His argument is multi-faceted and can be broken down into several key points:

*   **Caste as a System of Unfair Exclusion and Inclusion**:
    *   Thorat defines social exclusion as a process denying fair and equal opportunities to social groups in various spheres, hindering their full participation in society, economy, and polity, leading to human poverty and deprivation.
    *   Drawing on Amartya Sen's work, Thorat highlights two main forms of social exclusion: **"unfavourable exclusion"** (being kept out) and **"unfavourable inclusion"** (being included on greatly unfavourable or discriminatory terms, despite having access). Both have similar adverse effects.
    *   He asserts that the **caste system is inherently a system of "forced exclusion,"** where civil, cultural, and economic rights are pre-determined, unequal, and hereditary, enforced through social ostracism and economic penalties. This results in a "graded inequality" where higher castes accumulate rights and privileges at the expense of lower castes.
    *   For 'untouchables' (Dalits), this results in a **"double denial"**: denial of equal rights and "forced non-association" due to notions of impurity, leading to severe physical and social segregation and restrictions on mobility.

*   **Pervasive and Structural Nature of Discrimination**:
    *   Thorat argues that caste-based exclusion is **"structural in nature" and "comprehensive and multiple in coverage,"** manifesting across economic, civil, cultural, religious, and political spheres.
    *   **Economic Discrimination**: He identifies discrimination in various markets, including labor, land, credit, input, product, consumer goods, and housing. This can take forms such as:
        *   **Complete denial of employment** or denial of specific jobs (especially those considered "unclean").
        *   **Selective hiring but with lower wages** or unequal terms and conditions of work, including forced labor.
        *   **Restrictions on land sale/purchase/leasing**, access to credit (e.g., higher interest rates), and other inputs necessary for business activities.
        *   **Discriminatory pricing** in consumer markets (e.g., Dalits paying higher prices for goods they buy and receiving lower prices for goods they sell).
        *   He notes that these effects are **not "locational"** but travel from village to city and into virtually all markets.
    *   **Non-Market and Public Services Discrimination**: Dalits face exclusion and differential treatment in government-supplied services like education, healthcare, drinking water, public roads, and food security schemes (e.g., Midday Meals and Public Distribution System). This involves neglect, aversion to touch, separate waiting spaces, or even outright denial of access.
    *   **Social and Political Discrimination**: Dalits often experience social segregation in public spaces, societal boycotts, violence, and limited political participation.
    *   Thorat **distinguishes "group exclusion" from "individual exclusion,"** stressing that caste discrimination is based on group identity, irrespective of individual attributes, thus requiring group-focused policy interventions.

*   **Adverse Consequences on Poverty and Human Development**:
    *   The discrimination leads to **significant socio-economic disparities and human capital disadvantages**. This includes higher unemployment and under-employment, lower income, reduced ownership of income-earning assets, and exploitation.
    *   In education, it results in high illiteracy, low functional literacy, high dropout rates, limited skill development, and ultimately, lower human capital, leading to representation in menial jobs and low wages.
    *   In healthcare, it causes poor health status, increased sick days, and dependence on expensive private treatment, leading to debt and income loss.
    *   He also highlights the **"glass ceiling" effect in salaried employment and the "sticky floor" effect in self-employment** for Dalits, meaning discrimination impedes upward mobility and traps them at the bottom of the income distribution.

*   **Call for Policy Innovation and Empirical Measurement**:
    *   Thorat strongly advocates for **policy innovation to address market and non-market discrimination**, remove barriers, and provide support, especially in the informal and private sectors.
    *   He argues for the **inclusion of caste in global development policy debates**, alongside gender and race, given its profound impact on poverty and inequality.
    *   His work emphasizes the **critical need for empirical studies to capture the linkage between social exclusion and deprivation**, developing specific indicators and methodologies to identify and measure discriminatory practices in various sectors (e.g., health, education, food security) to inform evidence-based inclusive policies. He highlights that affirmative action, despite its limitations, has positive effects and without it, disparities would have been greater.
